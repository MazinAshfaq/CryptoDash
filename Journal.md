- Had a lot of issues with the navbar, but got that to work
  - The navbar itself wasn't hard to do, just the difference between router v6 and v5 made it very dificult to understand
  - Figured it out by pretty much reading documentation of what they did different between the two versions
- Had to switch my news api a couple of times just because of the request limit and as well as information.
  - I wanted for it to have pictures, but the api I was using didn't have image data in the json.
  - Changed it to bing search, which searches for crypto news, and displays it with description and images.
- Made the Crypto Search a lot easier to navigate throuhg by adding react-pagination.
  This pretty much takes all the data displayed and seperates to pages instead of just having it all in line making it super long.
